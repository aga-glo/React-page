                <p>I started my adventure with IT in 2018, when I get job as an intern. After a few months, I got a job as a Junior Project Manager in a software house in Krakow, where, due to the small size of the company, I had the opportunity to take a closer look at the work of testers and programmers on the frontend and backend. As part of my duties, I had the opportunity to do some simple things using HTML, CSS or JavaScript - which made me interested in this IT department - frontend coding.</p>
